## My process

I finished the HTML code adding some semantic tags as well as re bundling the information as needed in order to make it easier when implementing the CSS, I created a CSS file and linked it to the HTML file. Then, started to write down the CSS custom properties in order to achieve the design proposed in the project finally added some details to the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have practiced my HTML and CSS skills with this project and helping get settled the bases but the main thing I learned is how to use flexbox in order to order my components.

### Continued development

I would like to keep focusing in improving my HTML and CSS skills as well as the design area while I also learn and practice more about JS and React skills.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Resource](https://10015.io/tools/css-box-shadow-generator) - This helped me creating the shadow for the card so it will look as I wanted and more important showing a preview of how it should look like.
